# Visual-Search-Paradigm
An experiment to seek the difference between two visual search paradigms.
The subject is asked to determine if there is a "target" (the object possessing an unique feature) among a set of randomly displayed characters. They should press T or F on their keyboards to make judgement  as quickly as possible. Two different fashion of displaying objects are adopted, each of which corresponds to a particular paradigm of visual search (feature search and conjunction search). The Pearson Correlation Coefficients between RT(reaction time) and set size(number of randomly displayed characters) for each type of visual search are reported after the experiment.
